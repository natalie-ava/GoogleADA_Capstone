## 1. `satisfaction_monthly.pdf`
**Title:** Satisfaction vs. Monthly Hours  
This scatterplot examines how job satisfaction relates to the number of hours worked each month. We see that employees who work longer hours tend to report lower satisfaction. This pattern suggests that **overwork may be linked to dissatisfaction**, which in turn could increase the likelihood of departure.

## 2. `satisfactionleaving.pdf`
**Title:** Relationship Between Leaving the Company and Satisfaction Level  
This plot compares satisfaction levels between employees who stayed and those who left. It shows that **employees who left the company typically had much lower satisfaction levels**. This reinforces the importance of monitoring job satisfaction as a key factor in predicting turnover.

## 4. `salary_turnover.pdf`
**Title:** Turnover by Salary Level  
This bar chart illustrates how many employees left or stayed in each salary group. It clearly shows that **most of the employees who left had low or medium salaries**, while high-salary employees were more likely to stay. This suggests that **compensation may be a contributing factor to retention**.

## 5. `hrs_satisfaction.pdf`
**Title:** Relationship Between Average Monthly Hours and Satisfaction Level  
This density-based scatterplot further confirms that **employees working excessive hours often have lower satisfaction levels**. The clustering of low satisfaction in high-hour ranges suggests that **managing workload is critical to retaining employees**.

## 6. `heatmap.pdf`
**Title:** Correlation Heatmap of HR Features  
This chart shows how different features in the dataset relate to one another. The strongest finding is a **negative correlation between satisfaction and leaving**, meaning lower satisfaction is associated with higher turnover. Other weak or neutral correlations help confirm which features are less influential.

## 7. `evaluationleaving.pdf`
**Title:** Relationship Between Leaving the Company and Last Evaluation  
This plot reveals that employees who left the company had a wide range of performance scores. This means **even well-reviewed employees chose to leave**, suggesting that **performance alone doesn't ensure retention**, and high-performing employees may still be at risk.

## 8. `distoftenure.pdf`
**Title:** Distribution of Tenure  
This bar chart shows how long employees tend to stay at the company. The spikes at 3, 4, and 5 years could indicate **key points when employees reconsider their position**, possibly due to career stagnation, unmet expectations, or lack of advancement opportunities.
